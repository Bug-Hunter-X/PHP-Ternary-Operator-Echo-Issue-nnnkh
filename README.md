# PHP Ternary Operator and Echo Statement Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug involving the PHP ternary operator within an echo statement. The problem surfaces when the false branch of the ternary expression results in an empty string, potentially causing unexpected behavior or parse errors.

## The Issue
When using the ternary operator within string concatenation in an echo statement, PHP's handling of empty strings in this context can lead to unexpected results.  This is particularly noticeable when the false branch is an empty string or an uninitialized variable.

## Example
The `bug.php` file contains the problematic code. This code produces incorrect or unexpected outputs depending on the context and PHP version.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.php` demonstrates a corrected version.  The solution employs more explicit string concatenation or alternative approaches to handle cases where the ternary operator's false branch might produce an empty string, thereby ensuring the intended output is always achieved.
